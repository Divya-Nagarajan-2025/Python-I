calc.py is my very first coding once I decided to learn python. Its all about basic calculator operations where the user get access to perform addition, subtraction, multiiplication and division.
Stream.py is about presenting the previous calculator operations in a Website format using Steamlit framework. So here user can perform the operations in a web browser unlike cmd in previous calc.py
